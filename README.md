JS console rock paper scissors game

Very basic rock paper scissors game that you play in the console without any GUI.

HTML file links to script.js and you can play the game by opening index.html in a browser and opening the console.

Initial Javascript was very repetitive and inefficient. Created a new version using smarter logic for the the if else statemetns to determine the winner.
